# D3 chart using simple ES6 JavaScript

## Startup

* using any local HTTP server such as [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) or [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
* put on a web server 

## Advantages

* modern ES6 syntax with arrow functions
* extremely light weight -- zero node modules

## Disadvantages

* no static types enforced (not TypeScript!)
* no code completion (e.g., for d3 API)
* D3 dependency is not obvious from `package.json`
* starting is not obvious, unless `lite-server` is put into a `package.json`
