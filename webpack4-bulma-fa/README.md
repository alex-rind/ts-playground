## Setup

```
yarn init

yarn add --dev webpack webpack-cli ts-loader typescript webpack-dev-server webpack-merge
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --init

yarn add d3
yarn add --dev @types/d3

yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons

yarn add bulma
yarn add --dev css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin node-sass sass-loader
```

Adapting configuration files according to tutorials.

Production mode configured with `webpack-merge`.

## Startup

```
yarn install
npm start # dev & watch
```

## Advantages

* modern ES6/TypeScript syntax with arrow functions
* static types enforced (TypeScript)
* code completion (e.g., for d3 API)
* D3 dependency is obvious from `package.json`
* building and starting is obvious from `package.json`
* old-school way to include style and images from `dist` folder
* [fontawesome-svg-core](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/svg-javascript-core) allows to include only few icons in the `bundle.js` (44k instead of 633k)
* customizable Bulma styling

## Disadvantages

* D3 types in function statements can be quite cluttered (e.g., `d3.Selection<SVGSVGElement, any, HTMLElement, any>`)
* `node_modules` folder weights 102M
* hard to separate autogenerated files from assets in `dist` folder
