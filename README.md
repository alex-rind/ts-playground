# ts-playground
experimental D3 &amp; TypeScript project setups

## Desiderata

* D1: modern syntax ES6 or TypeScript
* D2: few and stable dependencies (for future proofness)
* D3: easy setup with npm install and npm start
* D4: code completion and warnings in VS Code
* D5: fast & automatic complilation and reloading in Chrome
* D6: small size for production

## Playgrounds

[ES6 JavaScript, no building](es6/)

[TypeScript and Webpack without HtmlLoader](webpack4-tsonly/)

[Parcel v1](parcelv1/)

[Svelte with TypeScript and Rollup](svelte-rollup/)
